# LaskaKit Memory LCD 2.7" 

The module with big LCD and ultra low-power consumption - that's [LaskaKit Sharp Memory LCD](https://www.laskakit.cz/sharp-ls027b7dh01-2-7--400x240-lcd-memory-displej/). The diagonal of display is 2.7inch and resolution is 400x240 px! 
The own power consumation is only 50 uW in static mode, 175 uW during refresh.

The SPI bus is 3.3V tolerant, but the MemoryLCD has to be powered from 5V. You can connect 5V directly from your source or you can use built-in step-up regulator. The step-up is connected to 3.3V and it step ups to 5V.

As you are already used, we wrote an example code. In this case for [ESP32-LPkit](https://www.laskakit.cz/laskakit-esp32-lpkit-pcb-antenna/). You can check how we initialize the Memory LCD and how to draw the logo. 

The module is available on https://www.laskakit.cz/sharp-ls027b7dh01-2-7--400x240-lcd-memory-displej/

P.S. If you want to know how to create your own logo and how to draw it, we wrote a tutorial how to do it: Check it on https://blog.laskarduino.cz/sharp-memorylcd-a-tvorba-a-zobrazeni-vlastniho-obrazku/
